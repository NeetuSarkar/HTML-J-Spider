Prototypes
Prototype Basics:

prototype property of functions
Internal [[Prototype]] chain
Prototype inheritance concept
Prototype Chain:

How JavaScript looks up the prototype chain
Accessing inherited properties and methods
Object.create():

Creating objects with specific prototypes
Use cases for Object.create()
__proto__ vs .prototype:

Differences between __proto__ (object-level property) and .prototype (function-level property)
Prototype Methods:

Object.getPrototypeOf()
Object.setPrototypeOf()
Overriding Properties/Methods:

Overriding inherited methods
Shadowing properties in the prototype chain
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
Basics of OOP:

What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Key principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
Creating Objects:

Object literals
Constructor functions
ES6 Classes
Inheritance:

Prototypal inheritance
Using Object.create() for inheritance
ES6 class inheritance (extends and super keywords)
Encapsulation:

Public and private properties
Using closures for private data
Private class fields (# syntax)
Polymorphism:

Method overriding in prototypes
Overriding methods in ES6 classes
Static Methods and Properties:

Defining static methods in ES6 classes
Use cases for static methods
Getters and Setters:

Using get and set keywords for computed properties
Benefits of encapsulating logic with getters and setters
Mixins:

Combining properties and methods from multiple objects
Use cases and implementation
Abstract Classes and Interfaces (Workarounds in JavaScript):

Simulating abstract classes using base classes
Implementing interfaces using manual checks
Prototype vs Class OOP:

Differences and similarities
When to use each approach
Advanced Topics
Object Composition:

Composition over inheritance
Delegation using Object.create()
The this Keyword:

Behavior in constructor functions, prototypes, and ES6 classes
Arrow functions vs regular functions
Factory Functions:

Creating objects without using new
Encapsulation using closures
instanceof and isPrototypeOf:

Checking inheritance relationships
How they work internally
